    Beer head (AKA head) is the frothy foam on top of liquid beer after it is poured in a glass. It is produced by bubbles of gas, typically carbon dioxide, rising to the surface.
    The density and longevity of the head will be determined by the type of malt and adjunct from which the beer was fermented. Different mash schedules and cereal sources influence head retention.
    In general, wheat tends to produce larger and longer lasting heads than barley.
